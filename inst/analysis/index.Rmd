# Project Information

Generation of materials for Harvard neo talk. This analysis was developed using a package structure, with
the analysis organized as a series of functions. If you are just joining this
project please start here to understand the over-arching goal of the analysis.
The functions are built to work as a stand-alone workflow, and can be run in the
correct order by calling the `bookdown::serve_book()` function with the
index.Rmd file open. This project makes use of caching for long-running analyses
but the cache is not tracked on git. The first run can be expected to take a
reasonably long amount of time after which subsequent renders are usually < 1 minute.
