# Generate Pseudo Data

In the final section of this presentation we will walk through a proposal that
pretty much all trial data can and should be turned into portable pseudo data
that is shared freely without restrictions. We will show two versions of this, 
one using `{synthpop}` and the other using `{mvProbit}`. Note that this repository
also includes the code necessary to do a bayesian version of the multivariate
probit model but since we aren't going to make use of the additional benefits
that go along with that we won't include it here since it is much slower to
fit and gives equivalent means.

## Generate data from synthpop

We will use vanilla default settings for synthpop since the data here is simulated
but in real applications there is a lot more fine tuning available.

```{r}
data("ex_dat")
```
