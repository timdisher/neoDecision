# What is the thesis of this presentation?
- Decisions are local
  - Rates, preferences, methods comfort
  - Trials are not flexible and totally open data is far away
  - Can we approximate open data with simple models?
  
Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to:

1.	Describe the purpose of decision theoretic approaches
2.	Give examples of ways in which neonatal studies could include components of decision theory
3.	Identify potential roadblocks to generalization of the results of neonatal trials for decision making
4.	Develop analysis plans that allow for flexible adaptations of results to new locations

- Latest thought on overall flow is:
  - I will teach you a simple way to get closer to decision theory (consenance curves)
  - A simple decision theory approach to prognostic models (decision curves)
  - A simple decision theory approach to RCTs (MCDA)
  - A package to make this portable

## What I Hope to Convince you of

> Every neonatal trial that is designed to influence practice decisions should
provide raw data, user-friendly code, and simple decision tools based on
multivariate outcomes

**I will offer whatever support I can to help anyone working towards these goals**

## What I Love about Neonatal Research

.pull-left[
### Robust and Collaborative
- Commitment to randomized controlled trials
- Thinking with an eye to meta-analyses
- Neonatal networks  
- Multidiscplinary

### Family Integrated
- Care paradigms centered around families (eg, fiCARE)
- Increased call for family preferences in guidelines

## What I Would Like to See More of

### Open Data

- Research will be more flexible and more portable if it's more open
  - Most common example is prediction tools
- What is preventing us from sharing the data itself?
  - Privacy rules (may not be the barrier we think it is)
  - Ownership/competition

### Decision Theory

- A set of methods/approach to analysis and interpretation of data that maximizes
"goodness"
  - Health economics, MCDA, win-ratio, and others
- We are already using pseudo decision theory by basing decisions off of statistical significance
  - $\alpha$ = 0.05 and $\beta$ = 0.8 suggests false positives four times worse than false negatives
  - Can we do better?

## Barriers to Use of Decision Theory in Neonatal Research

### Preferences are Personal

- All the methods we might be interested in require us to weight outcomes in
some way
  - Win-ratio and ordinal models: Ordinal ranking
  - MCDA: Ordinal or swing weighting
  - Cost-effectiveness/utility: Willingness to pay and valuing health states
  - Decision curves: Thresholds for treatment

### Plurality of Methods
  - Lack of shared experience means lack of confidence in planning outcomes/analyses
    - What will be convincing? What will generalize best?

### Misperceptions
 - I can't include a decision theory framework because I don't agree with the principals
 of method x

# Simulated Data | Shared Code | Simple Tools

# Simulated Data

> Your trial can't and doesn't have to provide a universal recommendation that
is valid under all preferences in all centers

- Implementing decision theoretic methods does not have to require we re-think
our entire approach to trials
  - You may not be able to capture costing data
  - You may not have resources for the most rigorous preference elicitation
  
.center.large[**We can take a small step towards incorporating decision theory in any 
trial and then lay the groundwork for others to adapt**]

- Synthetic data using machine learning based tools like the `synthpop` package
  - Risk of re-identification may be too high for public sharing

- Standard, well-researched analysis methods
  - Multivariate probit for binomial outcomes. Can be used for the primary analysis (and opens new doors as well)

# Shared Code

- Open-source revolution has been a boon for analysis methods, computer science,
and science communication.

- Tools for open code are easy to use and often within the toolbox of methodological
colleagues

- We can provide a tremendous benefit to trainees by showing them the process of
high-quality analysis
 - Many errors can be avoided and problems anticipated by seeing an example
 of analyses run on a similar dataset
 - When combined with simulated data, provides a powerful tool to help standardization
 of approach
  
  <br>
>Sharing your code can be scary but don't underestimate the upsides: You
can teach and learn just by engaging in the process. It also unlocks something
amazing: people will help you to improve your work.

# Simple Tools

In knowledge translation we often talk about the two "valleys of death" where
basic science discoveries fail to move into clinical research and clinical research
discoveries are delayed in entering practice.

- We can think of a third valley being that once we convince a clinician an intervention
can be helpful they then have to communicate this to patients

### Analyses based on decision theory methods need simple tools to help apply them

These can be as simple as Excel calculators (used with success for risk prediction tools)
or as complex as interactive web-apps but the whole purpose of decision tools is
to aid decision makers who might have preferences that are very different from yours
so you need to provide them the support to explore the implications of those preferences

# A Simulated Example

---
# Methods
- Simulate a simple RCT of a treatment
- Three outcomes total: Mortality, BPD, NEC
- Treatment decreases risk of BPD but increases risk of NEC/Death
---
# Evaluation
MCDA three ways
 - Additive high/low risk
 - Remove deaths from NEC probability high/low risk
 - P(meaningful BPD & non meaningful death or harm)
