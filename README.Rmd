**This Repository is a Work in Progress**

This repository holds relevant code and slides for a presentation on the use of
multivariate analyses to support open data, open code, and flexible tools for
decision modeling. I use a package structure to code this but it is meant mostly
to just to keep things organized and not to be installed as a package.

Slides are hosted on github pages [here](https://timdisher.github.io/neoDecision/inst/slides/improving-neo-decisions)
